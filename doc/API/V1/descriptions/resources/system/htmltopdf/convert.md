##### Filters
###### Syntax

Filters can only be applied where in the template ```Data``` is contained in the block and exists as an object. (e.g. ticket, article)
Only attributes that the object can supply can be filtered.

```
{
  "<Data-Object>": {
     "AND": [
      {
        "Field": "<Attribute>",
        "Type": "<EQ|CONTAINS>",
        "Value": "<ARRAY|STRING>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

###### Example

A ticket should only take into account the articles that are visible to the customer.

```
{
  "Article": {
    "AND": [
      {
        "Field": "CustomerVisible",
        "Type": "EQ",
        "Value": "1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Allows/Ignores
###### Syntax

In order to address the respective table, its ```Reference ID``` is required first. This can be found in the template structure. If the ID is known, a JSON can be created that contains the attributes to be restricted. There are two options for the restriction:
* By using the shortcut ```KEY```, the entire attribute will be ignored or displayed without further checking.
* By using a regular expression, the values of an attribute can be checked. If the respective value applies, the attribute is ignored or displayed. The regular expression is freely selectable. However, it must not contain ```KEY``` because ```KEY``` is the keyword for the entire attribute.

```
{
  "Reference-ID": {
     "Attribute": "KEY",
     "Attribute": "regex"
  }
}
```

###### Example

```
{
   "ArticleMeta": {
      "Channel": "KEY",
      "From": "cape-it.de$"
   }
}
```
